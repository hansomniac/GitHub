	<h1>THIS IS THE SECOND PAGE</h1>
		<p>Google has been updating the designs of some of its core services for some time now. Google Photos and Android Messages were some of the latest of Google apps to receive updates that brought their looks into line with Google`s Material Design 2 style. However, don`t expect to see a radically different Google News as a result of this update. Google News is already broadly in line with Google`s current design rules, only having been launched in May 2018, as a replacement for Google Play News.</p>

<p>As such, it`s a minor update, only introducing a dark mode. But as anyone who`s ever browsed their phone in darkness can attest, opening your phone to a bright and blinding theme can be a horrible experience. A darker theme can be much easier on the eyes, and it`s perfect for browsing the latest breaking news just after getting up in the morning, or just before putting your head down for the night.</p>
